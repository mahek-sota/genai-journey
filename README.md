## Bite-Sized Insights

I've compiled bite-sized information on various generative AI topics including large language models, diffusion models, prompt engineering, and practical applications. This documentation serves as both my personal knowledge repository and a resource for others interested in the field.

For the full collection of bite-sized insights and ongoing updates, check out my [Bite-Sized GenAI Insights Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TnfIZIu_RgoeBdqtV2cB2MK4Hs6-D73luUDn4t1aL2o/edit?tab=t.0).

- **Prompt Engineering:** Small tweaks in prompts can drastically change model outputs.
- **Model Selection:** Choose models based on task—text generation, image synthesis, etc.
- **Fine-Tuning:** Custom datasets can improve results for niche applications.
- **Ethics:** Always consider data privacy and responsible AI use.
